# ONVIF
This is a sample project in my attempt to learn about ONVIF protocol.

# Goal
To send continous stream of PTZ data to a camera over onvif using TouchDesginer.

# Project Current Status
`python-onvif-0.1.3/` is an ONVIF client implementation in python by [Falk Tannhaeuser](https://github.com/FalkTannhaeuser/python-onvif-zeep)

`onvif_hello_world.py` is a simple python script that currently gets the name of the camera and some other member information of the class ONVIFCamera().
